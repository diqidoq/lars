# Who am I ?

## Name confusion

My online nickname diqidoq (aka digidog, also on IRC). This is - if you say so -  my Open Source and Linux support/contribution and development nickname in the communities and on Github to seperate this whole thing from the actual person I am and what I actually do. It raised from my long-term contribution to the Drupal project and since then people know me nder this nick name and I kept it. 

My real name is Sebastian Ugovsky. Additionally there is a music producer pseudonym around: Gilmano. To look at it from scratch: I am an artist. But also an initiator, project lead and multimedia business man, most of it based on my work as an author, theater & film maker, composer and long term music producer and director with many stations of work in the world, like London, New York, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Los Angeles and many more.

I work in film and music industry over 30 years now. I lead several international projects and was involved in development of several AV software development for my inhouse repositories.

## And to come to the connection to this github papers here (LARS):

Drum programming was/is a very important part of one of the many music genres I am working in. For the downbeat and experimental music projects I regularely try to find the best ways to accomplish the intuitive drum programming way for somebody, who is really deep into rythm feel, drum sound, layering, attacks, releases, micro-timing, punch, flow, the flipping effect, etc. Somebody who is fast and needs fast interaction with a machine and is far beyond "boom clap boom clap" or BD,SN,HH on a midi track. I never felt happy with any solutions around on Windows, OSX. Even Fxpansions Guru or Geist(1,2) were not 90% from what I was after regarding "the right things on the fingertips" concept. I used them to produce film score titles for 2 US feature film productions with a russian rap artist performing on them: for the film Equalizer (Denzel Washington) and for a music title in Transformers III. But still things are missing. And Linux as the 100% platform for this would be a dream.
