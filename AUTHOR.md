# Who am I ?

My development community nickname is diqidoq (formerly digidog, also on IRC, Slack, etc). This is - if you say so -  my Open Source and Linux contribution/development nickname in the communities and on Github to seperate this whole thing from the actual person I am and what I *actually* do. It raised from my long-term contribution to the Drupal and the Debian project and since then people know me under this nickname and I kept it.

Drum programming was/is a very important part of one of the many music genres I am working in. For the downbeat and experimental music projects I regularely try to find the best ways to accomplish the intuitive drum programming way for somebody, who is really deep into rythm feel, drum sound, layering, attacks, releases, micro-timing, punch, flow, the flipping effect, etc. Somebody who is fast and needs fast interaction with a machine and is far beyond "boom clap boom clap" or BD,SN,HH on a midi track. I never felt happy with any solutions around on Windows, OSX. Even Fxpansions Guru or Geist(1,2) were not 90% from what I was after regarding "the right things on the fingertips" concept. I used them to produce film score titles for 2 US feature film productions with a russian rap artist performing on them: for the film Equalizer (Denzel Washington) and for a music title in Transformers III. But still things are missing. And Linux as the 100% platform for this would be a dream.
