# Who am I ?

## Some clearance regarding name confusion

My online nickname is diqidoq (aka digidog, both also on IRC). This is - if you say so -  my Open Source and Linux support and contribution/development nickname in the communities and on Github to seperate this whole thing from the actual person I am and what I *actually* do. It raised from my long-term contribution to the Drupal project and since then people know me under this nick name and I kept it. 

My name is *Sebastian Ugovsky*. Additionally there is a music producer pseudonym I've been often credited with: [*Gilmano*](https://www.google.de/search?q=Gilmano). To look at it from scratch: I am an artist. But also an initiator, director, project lead and multimedia business guy, most of it based on my work as an author, theater & film maker, composer and long term music producer and director with many stations of work, like in London, New York, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Los Angeles and some more.

I work in film and music industry over 30 years now and have been on stage with 4 the first time holding a violine in my hand. I lead several international projects, build several bigger music studios, initiated 4 companies and was involved in development of several AV software development for my inhouse repositories in the last decade.

## And to come to the connection to this github papers here (LARS):

Drum programming was/is a very important part of one of the many music genres I am working in. For the downbeat and experimental music projects I regularely try to find the best ways to accomplish the intuitive drum programming way for somebody, who is really deep into rythm feel, drum sound, layering, attacks, releases, micro-timing, punch, flow, the flipping effect, etc. Somebody who is fast and needs fast interaction with a machine and is far beyond "boom clap boom clap" or BD,SN,HH on a midi track. I never felt happy with any solutions around on Windows, OSX. Even Fxpansions Guru or Geist(1,2) were not 90% from what I was after regarding "the right things on the fingertips" concept. I used them to produce film score titles for 2 US feature film productions with a russian rap artist performing on them: for the film Equalizer (Denzel Washington) and for a music title in Transformers III. But still things are missing. And Linux as the 100% platform for this would be a dream.
