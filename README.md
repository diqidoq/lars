> From a long way of testing and writing bug reports, filing issues up to writing long letters to project maintainers, which have been never send because of doubts of mine if this is the right starting point, I came to the conclusion to start this roadmap for an *idea*.... It's just a twinkle in an eye ... and answers to the name: ...

# LARS (Linux audio rythm section machine)

 + a fully featured and flexible pattern based rythm section machine to manage samples, midi, triggering, and many more
 + as a *stand alone* machine with in/out management or as a lv2 plugin
 + to make Linux pro audio even more sexy than it already is :-)
 + to integrate perfect with awesome projects like my favourite Ardour and JACK or Mixbus, but also with Qtractor, LMMS and others
 + to really show off and support the advantages from Linux OS modular audio concepts and work flows over other OS
 + to fulfil a dream of mine: to finally fill the gap of real intuitive and useful rythm section programming for the pros and their qualified fingertips.

> This document is a work in progress, so please do not feel offended or badly affected by wrongly shaped paragraphs, missing facts or anything weird for you to read until it is finished. I decided to make the progress on this document public to the Open Source community to contribute to it for a faster and more open minded finished result.

Were do I come from to write this?
----------------------------------

All has started with a planned and written 5 pages letter to the developers of Hydrogen, a very potential and long time existing drum machine software for Linux. I have - as always - many respect for the hard work which goes into Open Source projects to make software available for professionals working on Linux like this. And I can't say it often enough how often this movement gets misunderstood and the developers and contributors treated badly IMHO. I don't want to go too deep into what community driven open source projects is about and how it works and how to contribute to them. I only want to make clear how much repect I have for this projects and how much I was already involved in such attempts and how hard it is for me to find the right way to go for this issue.

[Here](CHATLOG.md) is a short excerpt out of an IRC chat were the idea was born to start this document.

Were are we now?

 + There are some examples of "close to what it can be" in the 

Well, let me shape it the other way around: there is a niche of people who has never been 99% satisfied with any of the new age drum or rythm section developing philosophy on computer based software yet. I can tell you that for granted. Painting events in a completely other corner of the UI than where you switch samples, layers, attacks, releases, sustains, curves, micro timing, midi setting changes, swing modes, etc. becomes a pain in the speed and work flow of a rythm professional. And these are the guys who need a voice here. Listening to them would inspire many others because it is a very underrated topic. Because of the misunderstanding what it is. Or maybe better sayed: what it can be. Rythm section programming is far beyond what many think of when they put their basedrum and snare layers and hihats in a midi region, go back to their bank to change some properties and mix them finally (to say it simple). Programming should be one way of many. A rythm guru is fast, and he needs something fast on his finger tips. If there would be a proper software, I would be able to play drums (even on a midi drumstation), record them, split them on keys, mix them with samples, which can be easely exchanged on the fly while the loop still runs from my library. I can switch many important settings with key commands and near by near interface spots. A rythm expert feels the "breath" of his section before it is finished and he needs to write it down fast. Like an author and his dictaphone. Hydrogen was close to some parts of FxPansions Geist, but only on some points. As often, its all about priorities. Which functionality has prio and comes first for such an approach. Thats what makes the difference between many computer audio instruments.

Additionally there are many other aspects to consider:
------------------------------------------------------
 + required replacements for proprietary and much outdated file formats like rex2 (maybe a wav > marker kind of thing?)
 + some maybe not too useful but sadly common concepts need to stay implemented to gain a big enough audience to build a community.
