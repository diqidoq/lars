# Hydrogen future, the website, the communication for contributors

> There are so many questions regarding the whole Hydrogen project raising over the last months (or even years?), I don't even know where to start.

But, maybe let me start from here (me) to get the whole picture: This info is placed [here now](AUTHOR.md).

The potential of Hydrogen is much higher than many would probably think of, I am pretty sure. For many its just another drum thingy. While some developers may know that it's not, many "users" do not. It's all about making clear what Hydrogen can accomplish what others can't. IT actually HAD THE POTENTIAL to be the intuitive and fast drum machine on the qualified fingertips, others aren't. But it makes me sad to see how things go wrong IMHO with Hydrogen, and the aging process makes it even worse and it feels like never leaving a certain beta kind of feeling. And this where my decision came from to write this letter. I know how hart it is to contribute to an open source project without financial support and limited time. But many possible chances to optimize a situation can fade by missing options.

So let me write a list of questions raising and if I wasn't too offending hopefully some of the contributors or developers can chime in to give their 2 cents to my concerns. Please notice that my motivation is coupled with the will to support, contribute and help the project but only if the minds are open. Some questions are simple, others are more generic, others are maybe too far beyond a simple possible answer.

1.) If Hydrogen is on Github why the installation from source documentation still recommends svn? Concentrate on one place for developement, bug tracking and more. Github is absolutely fine for an open-source project like Hydrogen. And others services, which are build around Github or Gitlab are easy to add. They are modern, neat, clean and often helpful to speed up communication and protocoling/reporting.

2.) Why nobody from the closer cycle can't be found on typical developer channels like IRC or runs some more PR in the web like on twitter about the project? There are social sync service and mosules for your CMS available doinf the job for you. It feels so outdated to get in contact with Hydrogen guys. I would love to see some of you Hydrogen guys in IRC or somewhere else at minimum. There is no chance for active pro audio Linux contributors, who regularly talk on IRC to each other, to catch you for some exchange. This would live things up.

3.) The website feels kind of broken at some point (and I know what I am talking about).

 + Sometimes it says you are logged in, sometimes not. 
 + Links are dead and docs are far outdated.
 + The forum activity is low because the forum lacks many useful additions.
 + The website ad forum is damn sloooow.
 + The input forms act weird. DId you know that? This is like 90's.
 + Why not making a hard cut here and start a new fresh Drupal 8 installation with a modern Bootstrap or whatever mobile first design
 + Users and forum posts etc can be synchronized or copied via feed import or migration modules
 
4.) Broken features (testing env: Debian 9 LXDE, Hydrogen 0.9.7 and compiled from source)

 + Import Export library does not work flawless. A simply exported library should simply be able to be imported and work again. It does not (at least on Linux).
 + The <info> group of an exported library is broken under Linux, maybe caused by a broken export text file type character coding set.
 + Overall experience users tell me is that Hydrogen acts weird on some points here and there with no clue whats up and there are only few resources to read about it. And it is very sensitive about HOW you do things. But this is not how software should be. Software should only provide functions, which it can really unmistakenly manage or there should be clear and easy to reach sources explaining the HOW to not break it.
 + A manual should have a search or filter function to be able to jump to search words. This is a standart function on pdf viewers and common by users who regularely read manuals.
 + The GUI of Hydrogen should be flexible and stretchable to cover the many different screen sizes nowadays. Fixed size interfaces are quite out of date.
 + ...
 
 Here I was starting to worry if I would ever sent this letter ...
